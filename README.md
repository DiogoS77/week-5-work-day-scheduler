## Description

This project is a creation of work day scheduler. This work day scheduler contains nine blocks with times from 9 am to 5 pm.
The main focus of this work day scheduler was to keep it the most simple as possible , so the user can use it without any issues.
This page contains one javascript file, one css file and one html file.

The biggest challenge i found was definitly the javascript part, i was a bit confused how to start it but after some time thinking i did manage to start it and fix the errors that i was getting after it.
And another big challenge i found was to understand how i could replace the current html code that was setting up the hours and change it to a container.

This challenge helped me a lot because it made my javascript thinking better in a way that i could work with it more easier after understanding it and also helped me understanding how to start it. I will also be listing bellow some aspects in where this challenge helped me.

- Define the starting point
- Javascript working speed improvment
- Better Javascript understanding
